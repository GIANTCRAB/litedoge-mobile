# Privacy Policy

The LiteDoge team is committed to ensuring your privacy while using the LiteDoge mobile wallet. As the mobile wallet does not store any on-chain information, it needs to communicate with relevant community run services in order to operate.

## Camera Permission

Camera permission is used solely for the use of scanning QR code. No image data is sent to any of our community hosted servers.

## Block Explorer

The mobile application communicates with the community-run block explorer to retrieve chain information. Your public address is used for retrieving only the relevant transaction information. No private keys will ever leave your phone through this means. No information is shared with any third-party.

The block explorer is run by one of our developers, Skyler.

## Wallet Proxy

The mobile application communicates with the community-run wallet proxy that does watch-only actions. Your public address is used for retrieving unspent transactions and cached for future balance retrieval. No private keys will ever leave your phone through this means. No information is shared with any third-party.

The wallet proxy is run by one of our developers, Huiren.

## No Change Address

Unfortunately, the current LiteDoge mobile does not implement Change Address automatically to ensure privacy. This is to make sure that the wallet is sufficiently lightweight and does not hold too many address information. 

Some implementations of other lightweight wallets out there implements Change Address and encounter loading issues when there are too many transactions conducted.
